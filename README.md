# Item Management App

This repository contains the **Item Management App** project developed during my training period, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to input items and their quantities, validate the input, and add them to a list. The list is persistent across page refreshes by using local storage. Additionally, users can update or remove individual items, and there is a "Remove All" button to clear the entire list.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple, interactive item management app that allows users to add, update, remove, and persist items in a list. The app uses local storage to ensure that the items remain even after the page is refreshed, enhancing user experience and functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
